To execute an attack:
1.run ping.c file and create the object file as ping.o
2.write the victim's IP as the 1st argument and another Active machine's IP as the 2nd argument in the script.sh file
3.For different machines use different 2nd argument in the script.sh file
4.run bash script.sh to execute the attack
5.Each action in ping.c is commented properly there

I used WireShark to monitor the packets
